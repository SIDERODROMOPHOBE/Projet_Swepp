# Token Swapping plateform, using on chain Oracle Data

Using this WebApp, you can Swap BadAppel Tokens for StabloCoans token, matching the BAP token price on ETH price.
We are using Chainlink Oracle to query the present price.
The smart contracts are hosted on Goerli Network

## This app provides 3 Smart contracts :
1- BadApple Token (foundry/src/Token1.sol)  Goerli address : 0x174562BA0BDb890fFd7046C8890EDeEA30eEe93D
2- StableCoan Token (foundry/src/Token2.sol)     Goerli address : 0x0c302E08DBB72a3F361512137936aD2cfA21eC74
3- AMM marketplace contract (foundry/src/Marketplace.sol)  Goerli address : 0x62c1f8F144f612875BA8AfC74A2504c567615930

Most of the Wagmi work is done on the component Swapper.tsx (src/components/swapper.tsx)
The Webapp Front-end is hosted on Vercel, and accessible [Here](https://projet-swepp.vercel.app/) 


# IF UI NOT WORKING PROPERLY :
Unfortunately, during concecption i ran out of Goerli Ether si Icould not test the whole UI.
The swap is SUPPOSED to work, I am so sorry if it does not, i will correct it when i get more Goerli Ether üò≠

If not working, the swap is still possible by hand using the Etherscan interface :
First Allow the contract to use your token by using [this Approve Function](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x174562BA0BDb890fFd7046C8890EDeEA30eEe93D#writeContract#F3) 

use 0x62c1f8F144f612875BA8AfC74A2504c567615930 as value for Spender
and dont forget to add eighteen 0's after the uint256 value

Then you can do the swap by using [this function](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x62c1f8f144f612875ba8afc74a2504c567615930#writeContract#F1)

and entrering the EXACT AMOUNT of token to swap (do not add the eighteen 0's after)


I am so sorry again if you have to go through this, Screw my Poverty üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´
